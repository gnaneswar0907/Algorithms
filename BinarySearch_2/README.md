#### [Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/BinarySearch_2/SearchRange.java)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1]

```java
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

#### [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/BinarySearch_2/MinInSortedArray.java)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

```java
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
```
