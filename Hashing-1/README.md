### [Group Anagrams](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-1/GroupAnagrams.java)

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

```java
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

### [Isomorphic Strings](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-1/IsomorphicStrings.java)

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

```java
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

### [Word Pattern](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-1/WordPattern.java)

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

```java
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```
