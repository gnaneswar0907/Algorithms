# Array

- [Shuffle the Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/ShuffleArray.java)

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

```java
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]

```

- [Diagonal Traverse](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/DiagonalTraversal.java)

Given a matrix of M x N elements (M rows, N columns), return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order as shown in the below image.

```java
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]
```

- [Spiral Matrix](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/SpiralMatrix.java)

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

```java
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

- [Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/DisappearedNumbers.java)

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

```java
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```
