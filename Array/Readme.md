# Array

- [Shuffle the Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/ShuffleArray.java)

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

```java
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]

```java
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]
```

- [Spiral Matrix](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Array/SpiralMatrix.java)

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

```java
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```
