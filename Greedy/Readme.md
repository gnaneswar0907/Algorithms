- [Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Greedy/BalancedString.java)

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings. Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

```java
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
