### [Longest Palindrome](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-2/LongestPalindrome.java)

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters. This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

```java
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

### [SubArray Sum Equals K](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-2/SubArraySum.java)

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

```java
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

### [Contiguous Array](https://github.com/gnaneswar0907/Algorithms/blob/master/Hashing-2/ContiguousArray.java)

Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

```java
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```
